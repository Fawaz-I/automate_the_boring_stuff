# Chapter 2 Exercise Workspace

Mirror workflow: complete this chapter in `offline_content/index.html`, then practice here.

## Project initialization (manual muscle memory)

1. `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. `python -m pip install -U pip`
4. Create files/folders yourself for this chapter (`src`, `tests`, scripts, notes).
5. Run your code and iterate.

Keep this folder lightweight so you can re-initialize from scratch when needed.
