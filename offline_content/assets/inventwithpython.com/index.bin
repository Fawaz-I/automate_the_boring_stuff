    <p><strong>Learning to program makes you a smarter and more capable human being.</strong> Rocket science uses programming, but programming isn't rocket science. Whether you're a student preparing for a software career, an office worker buried under spreadsheet files, or a hobbyist who wants to make video games, the Python programming language is an excellent start in the world of programming.</p>
<p>I'm Al Sweigart, and I write books to teach beginners to code. I put them online for free because programming is too valuable and needs to be accessible to all. (You can also buy print and ebooks versions.) My approach takes out the intimidation so that you can become productive and enjoy the creative aspects of coding.</p>
<p>Get started today. And good luck on your programming journey!</p>

<p><strong>Learn Coding for Automation</strong> Everyone in the 21st century needs to learn to code, right? But not everyone needs to become a software engineer or computer scientist. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is written for office workers, students, administrators, and anyone who uses a computer how to write small, practical programs to automate tasks on their computer.</p>
<p>You don't need to know all the complexities of algorithms and syntax, you just want to write basic programs to automate mundane computer tasks. In the process, even total beginners will learn to use Python to control their computers without having to learn complex information about computer science. This is a practical programming guide for the rest of us.</p>

<p><strong>Recursion, Understandable by Humans</strong> Recursion, and recursive algorithms, have a reputation for being intimidating. They're seen as an advanced computer science topic often brought up in coding interviews. Moreover, coders often perceive the use of a recursive algorithm as a sophisticated solution that only true programmers can produce. But there's nothing magical about recursion. Its fearsome reputation is more a product of poor teaching than of the complexity of recursion itself.</p>
<p>This book teaches the basics of recursion, exposes the ways it's often poorly taught, and clarifies the fundamental principles behind all recursive algorithms. It is project-based, containing complete, runnable programs in both Python and JavaScript, and covers several common recursive algorithms for tasks like calculating factorials, producing numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, tree traversal, maze solving, binary search, quicksort and merge sort, Karatsuba multiplication, permutations and combinations, and solving the eight queens problem.</p>
<p>The book also explains tail call optimization and memoization, concepts often employed to produce effective recursive algorithms, and the call stack, which is a critical part of how recursive functions work but is almost never explicitly pointed out in lessons on recursion. The last chapter, on fractals, culminates with examples of the beautiful fractal shapes recursion can produce.</p>

<p><strong>Simple Exercises to Improve Your Skills</strong> Many books and websites have aggressive programming challenges for top coders. However, <em>Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained</em> is for the rest of us. We want challenges that improve our coding skills, not leave us confused and discouraged. Other tutorials and books have taught you the basics of Python, but the 42 programming exercises in this book let you practice what you've learned. Selected for their simplicity, these programming problems include gentle explanations of the problem, the prerequisite coding concepts you’ll need to understand the solution, and helpful templates to put together the programs if you have trouble starting from scratch.</p>
<p>This is the perfect book for beginner and intermediate programmers who want to test their Python skills but aren’t ready to begin professional-level software development. You don’t need the frustration of being expected to create complex algorithms and computer science theory; you need a large set of programming challenges that meet you at your level, with gentle explanations.</p>
<p>The professionally-formatted ebook is <a href="/amazon-pythongently">available on Amazon for 99 cents</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Make Python Games with Graphics</strong> Making Games with Python &amp; Pygame covers the Pygame library with the source code for 11 games. Making Games was written as a sequel for the same age range as Invent with Python. Once you have an understanding of the basics of Python programming, you can now expand your abilities using the Pygame library to make games with graphics, animation, and sound.</p>
<p>The book features the source code to 11 games. The games are clones of classics such as Nibbles, Tetris, Simon, Bejeweled, Othello, Connect Four, Flood It, and others.</p>

<h2>The Simple Turtle Tutorial</h2>
<p><a href="/stt/"><img src="/stt/orig_screenshot_click_spiral.webp" style="float:right; max-width: 25%;"></a>Turtle graphics is an easy way to learn programming by drawing with code. You program a virtual pen, called the turtle, to move around the screen and draw lines. You make pictures with a computer while learning how to program. You can think of the turtle as an Etch A Sketch controlled by your Python program. <a href="/stt/">The Simple Turtle Tutorial</a> explains how to use Python's turtle module.</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p><img src="/images/al-sweigart.webp" class="img-float-left" style="border-radius: 50%; height: 100px" alt="Al Sweigart portrait"></p>
<p>Al Sweigart (rhymes with "why dirt") is a software developer, tech book author, artist, and Fellow of the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Software Foundation</a>. He is the maintainer of several open source projects, including <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui">PyAutoGUI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip">pyperclip</a>. He enjoys writing software, <a href="https://scrollart.org">creating digital art</a>, fostering cats, <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/types-of-blood-donations/platelet-donation.html">donating platelets</a>, folding origami, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeTrashed/">picking up litter</a>.</p>
<p>His parents paid for his tuition and living expenses at the University of Texas at Austin and he graduated debt free. This allowed him to take a risk and move to Silicon Valley, which directly led to writing <em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</em> and his author career. He considers the goal of socialism not to be "free stuff" but to make the benefits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generational_wealth">generational wealth</a> available to all.</p>
<p>Reports that Al is an AI have been grossly exaggerated.</p>
