<p class="introtni">You’re probably used to organizing information into spreadsheets such as Excel or Google Sheets, but most software stores its data in applications called <i class="calibre18">databases</i>. Databases make it easy for your programs to retrieve the specific data you want. If you had a spreadsheet or text file of cats and wanted to find the fur color of a cat named Zophie, you could press <small class="calibre19">CTRL</small>-F and enter “Zophie.” But what if you wanted to find the fur color of all cats that weighed between 3 and 5 kilograms and were born before October 2023? Even with the regular expressions from <span class="chapterintro_xref">Chapter 9</span>, this would be a tricky thing to code.</p>
<p class="tx"><span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-1090" aria-label="384"></span>Databases allow you to perform complex queries like this one, written in the mini language of <i class="calibre5">Structured Query Language (SQL)</i>. You’ll see the term <i class="calibre5">SQL</i> used to refer to both a language for database operations and the databases that understand this language; it’s often pronounced “es-cue-el” but also sometimes “sequel.” This chapter introduces you to SQL and database concepts using <i class="calibre5">SQLite</i> (pronounced either “sequel-ite,” “es-cue-lite,” or “es-cue-el-ite”), a lightweight database included with Python.</p>
<p class="tx">SQLite is the most widely deployed database software, as it runs on every operating system and is small enough to embed within other applications. At the same time, SQLite’s simplifications make it notably different from other databases. While large database software such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle are intended to run on dedicated server hardware accessed over a network, SQLite stores the entire database in a single file on your computer.</p>
<p class="tx">Even if you’re already familiar with SQL databases, SQLite has enough of its own quirks that you should read this chapter to learn how to make the most of it. You can find the online SQLite documentation at <i class="calibre5"><a href="https://sqlite.org/docs.html" class="calibre1">https://<wbr></wbr>sqlite<wbr></wbr>.org<wbr></wbr>/docs<wbr></wbr>.html</a></i> and the Python <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3</span> module documentation at <i class="calibre5"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" class="calibre1">https://<wbr></wbr>docs<wbr></wbr>.python<wbr></wbr>.org<wbr></wbr>/3<wbr></wbr>/library<wbr></wbr>/sqlite3<wbr></wbr>.html</a></i>.</p>

<p class="tni">Let’s consider the similarities and differences between spreadsheets and databases. In a spreadsheet, rows contain individual records, while columns represent the kind of data stored in the fields of each record. For example, Figure 16-1 is a spreadsheet of some of my cats. The columns list the name, birthday, fur color, and weight (in kilograms) of each cat.</p>
<figure class="img"><img class="img2" id="calibre_link-777" src="../assets/automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/images/000033.jpg" alt="An Excel spreadsheet containing the columns “Name”, “Birthdate”, “Fur”, and “Weight kg.” The rows are populated with information about cats." />
<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Figure 16-1: A spreadsheet stores data records as rows with a set column structure.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx"><span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-1087" aria-label="385"></span>We can store this same information in a database. You can think of a database <i class="calibre5">table</i> as a spreadsheet, and a database can contain one or more tables. Tables have columns of different properties for each <i class="calibre5">record</i>, also called a <i class="calibre5">row</i> or <i class="calibre5">entry</i>. Databases like SQLite are called <i class="calibre5">relational databases</i>, where <i class="calibre5">relation</i> means that the database can contain multiple tables with relationships between them, as you’ll later see.</p>
<p class="tx">Both spreadsheets and databases label the data they contain. A spreadsheet automatically labels the columns with letters and the rows with numbers. In addition, the example cat spreadsheet uses its first row to give the columns descriptive names. Each of the subsequent rows represents exactly one cat. In a SQL database, tables often have an ID column for each record’s <i class="calibre5">primary key</i>: a unique integer that can unambiguously identify the record. In SQLite, this column is called <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">rowid</span>, and SQLite automatically adds it to your tables.</p>
<p class="tx">Deleting a spreadsheet row moves up all the rows underneath it, changing their row numbers. But a database record’s primary key ID is unique and doesn’t change. This is useful in many situations. What if a cat were renamed or had a change in weight? What if we wanted to reorder the rows to list the cats alphabetically by name? Each cat needs a unique identification number that remains constant no matter how the data changes. We could add a Row ID column to our spreadsheet to simulate a SQLite table’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">rowid</span> column. This ID value would stay the same even if rows were deleted or moved around the spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 16-2, where the cats with the Row IDs of 5 to 10 are deleted.</p>
<figure class="img"><img class="img1" id="calibre_link-778" src="../assets/automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/images/000034.jpg" alt="Two versions of an Excel spreadsheet with the columns “Row ID”, “Name”, “Birthdate”, “Fur”, and “Weight kg”. The “Row ID” column contains sequential ID numbers. In the second version of the spreadsheet, the rows with the IDs 5 through 10 have been deleted, and the column jumps straight from the row with the ID value of 4 to the row with the ID value of 11." />
<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Figure 16-2: The Row ID number, unlike the spreadsheet row numbers, offers a unique identifier for each record (left) even after cats with IDs 5 to 10 are deleted (right).</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx"><span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-1205" aria-label="386"></span>There is a second way people use spreadsheets that is entirely unlike how databases tend to store data. Spreadsheets can serve as templates for forms rather than as row-based data storage. You may have seen spreadsheets such as Figure 16-3.</p>
<figure class="img"><img class="img1" id="calibre_link-779" src="../assets/automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/images/000035.jpg" alt="An Excel spreadsheet with the text “Time Slot Assignments for Site B Laboratory” in Row 1, the values “Time”, “Staff #1”, “Staff #2”, “Staff #3”, and “Staff #4” in row two, various time slots in the remaining column A cells, and various names in the remaining B through E cells. Column C also includes days of the week." />
<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Figure 16-3: A spreadsheet with a lot of formatting and a fixed sized is generally not a good fit for a database.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx">These spreadsheets tend to have a lot of formatting, with background colors, merged cells, and different fonts, so that they look good to human eyes. While the row-based data spreadsheets can expand infinitely downward as new data is added, these spreadsheets usually have a fixed size and fill-in-the-blank design. They’re often meant for humans to print out and look at, rather than for a Python program to extract data from them.</p>
<p class="tx">Databases aren’t visually pleasing; they just contain raw data. More importantly, while spreadsheets give you the flexibility of putting any data into any cell, databases have a stricter structure to make data retrieval easier for software. If your data tends to look like the example in Chapter 14</span> and the EZSheets library from <span>Chapter 15</span> and leaving it in an Excel or Google spreadsheet.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-1892"><span id="calibre_link-432"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">SQLite vs. Other SQL Databases</span></h3>
<p class="tni">If you’re used to working with other SQL databases, you might be wondering how SQLite compares. In short, SQLite strikes a balance between simplicity and power. It’s a full relational database that uses SQL to read and write massive amounts of data, but it runs within your Python program and <span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-1089" aria-label="387"></span>operates on a single file. Your program imports the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3</span> module just as it would import <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sys</span>, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">math</span>, or any other module in the Python standard library.</p>
<p class="tx">Here are the main differences between SQLite and other database software:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="bl">SQLite databases are stored in a single file, which you can move, copy, or back up like any other file.</li>
<li class="bl">SQLite can run on computers with few resources, such as embedded devices or decades-old laptops.</li>
<li class="bl">SQLite is serverless; it doesn’t require a background server application to constantly run on your laptop, or any dedicated server hardware. There are no network connections involved.</li>
<li class="bl">From the perspective of users, SQLite doesn’t require any installation or configuration. It’s part of the Python program.</li>
<li class="bl">For faster performance, SQLite databases can exist entirely in memory and be saved to a file before the program exits.</li>
<li class="bl">While SQLite columns have data types, such as numbers and text, just as other SQL databases do, SQLite doesn’t strictly enforce a column’s data type.</li>
<li class="bl">There are no permission settings or user roles in SQLite. SQLite has no <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">GRANT</span> or <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">REVOKE</span> statements like in other SQL databases.</li>
<li class="bl">SQLite is public domain software; you can use it commercially or any way you want without restriction.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tx">The main disadvantage of SQLite is that it can’t efficiently handle hundreds or thousands of simultaneous write operations (say, from a social media web app). Aside from that, SQLite is just as powerful as any database, able to reliably handle GBs or even TBs of data, as well as simultaneous read operations, quickly and easily.</p>
<p class="tx">SQLite sells itself not so much as a competitor to other database software but as a competitor to using the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">open()</span> function to work with text files (or the JSON, XML, and CSV files you’ll learn about in <span>Chapter 18</span>). If your program needs the ability to store and quickly retrieve large amounts of data, SQLite is a better alternative to JSON or spreadsheet files.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-1893"><span id="calibre_link-433"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Creating Databases and Tables</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Let’s begin by creating our first database and table using SQL. SQL is a mini language you can work with from within Python, much like regex for regular expressions. Like regex, SQL queries are written as Python string values. And just as you could write your own Python code to perform the text pattern-matching that regular expressions perform, you <i class="calibre5">could</i> write your own custom Python code to search for matching data in Python dictionaries and lists. But writing regular expressions and SQL database queries makes these tasks much simpler in the long run, even if they first require you to learn a new skill. Let’s explore how to write queries that create tables in a new database.</p>
<p class="tx"><span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-1048" aria-label="388"></span>We’ll create a sample SQLite database in a file named <i class="calibre5">example.db</i> to store information about cats. To create a database, first import the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3</span> module. (The <i class="calibre5">3</i> is for SQLite major version 3, which is unrelated to Python 3.) A SQLite database lives in a single file. The name of the file can be anything, but by convention we give it a <i class="calibre5">.db</i> file extension. The extension <i class="calibre5">.sqlite</i> is also commonly used.</p>
<p class="tx">A database can contain multiple tables, and each table should store one particular type of data. For example, one table could contain records of cats, while another table could contain records of vaccinations given to specific cats in the first table. You can think of a table as a list of tuples, where each tuple is a table row. The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">cats</span> table is essentially the same as <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">[('Zophie', '2021-01-24', 'black', 5.6), ('Colin', '2016-12-24', 'siamese', 6.2), ...]</span>, and so on.</p>
<p class="tx">Let’s create a database, then create a table for the cat data, insert some cat records into it, read the data from the database, and close the database connection.</p>
<section type="division" aria-labelledby="sec4">
<h4 class="h1" id="calibre_link-1894"><span id="calibre_link-434"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Connecting to Databases</span></h4>
<p class="tni">The first step of writing SQLite code is getting a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Connection</span> object for the database file by calling <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3.connect()</span>. Enter the following into the interactive shell:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">import sqlite3</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db', isolation_level=None)</b>
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The first argument to the function can be either a string of a filename or a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">pathlib.Path</span> object for the database file. If this filename doesn’t belong to an existing SQLite database, the function creates a new file containing an empty database. For example, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3.connect('example.db', isolation_level=None)</span> connects a database file named <i class="calibre5">example.db</i> in the current working directory. If this file doesn’t exist, the function creates an empty one.</p>
<p class="tx">If the file you connect to exists but isn’t a SQLite database file, Python raises a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3.DatabaseError: file is not a database</span> exception once you try to execute queries. <span>“Checking Path Validity” in Chapter 10</span> explains how to use the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">exists() Path</span> method and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">os.path.exists()</span> function, which can tell your program if a file exists or not.</p>
<p class="tx">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">isolation_level=None</span> keyword argument causes the database to use autocommit mode. This relieves you of having to write <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">commit()</span> method calls after each <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">execute()</span> method call.</p>
<p class="tx">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3.connect()</span> function returns a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Connection</span> object, which we store in a variable named <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">conn</span> for these examples. Each <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Connection</span> object connects to one SQLite database file. You can, of course, choose any variable name you’d like for this <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Connection</span> object, and you should use more descriptive variable names if your program opens multiple databases at the same time. But for small programs that connect to only one database at a time, the name <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">conn</span> is easy to write and descriptive enough. (The name <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">con</span> <span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-971" aria-label="389"></span>would be even shorter, but is easy to misunderstand as “<i class="calibre5">con</i>sole,” “<i class="calibre5">con</i>tent,” or “<i class="calibre5">con</i>fusing name for a variable.”)</p>
<p class="tx">When your program is done with the database, call <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">conn.close()</span> to close the connection. The program also closes the connection automatically when it terminates.</p>
</section>
<section type="division" aria-labelledby="sec5">
<h4 class="h1" id="calibre_link-1895"><span id="calibre_link-435"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Creating Tables</span></h4>
<p class="tni">After connecting to a new, blank database, create a table with a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">CREATE TABLE</span> SQL query. To run SQL queries, you must call the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">execute()</span> method of <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Connection</span> objects. Pass this <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">conn.execute()</span> method a string of the query:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">import sqlite3</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db', isolation_level=None)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">conn.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cats (name TEXT NOT NULL,</b>
<b class="calibre10">birthdate TEXT, fur TEXT, weight_kg REAL) STRICT')</b>
&lt;sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x00000201B2399540&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">By convention, SQL keywords, such as <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">CREATE</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">TABLE</span>, are written using uppercase letters. However, SQLite doesn’t enforce this; the query <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'create table if not exists cats (name text not null, birthdate text, fur text, weight_kg real) strict'</span> runs just fine. Table and column names are also case-insensitive, but the convention is to make them lowercase and to separate multiple words with underscores, as in <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">weight_kg</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">CREATE TABLE</span> statement raises a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3.OperationalError: table cats already exists</span> exception if you try to create a table that already exists without the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">IF NOT EXISTS</span> part. Including this part is a quick way to avoid tripping over this exception, and you’ll almost always want to add it to your <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">CREATE TABLE</span> queries.</p>
<p class="tx">In our example, we follow the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS</span> keywords with the table name <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">cats</span>. After the table name is a set of parentheses containing the column names and data types.</p>

<h4 class="h1" id="calibre_link-1896"><span id="calibre_link-436"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Defining Data Types</span></h4>
<p class="tni">There are six data types in SQLite:</p>
<p class="listplain"><span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">NULL </span>Analogous to Python’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">None</span></p>
<p class="listplain"><span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">INT</span> <b class="calibre10">or</b> <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">INTEGER</span> Analogous to Python’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">int</span> type</p>
<p class="listplain"><span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">REAL </span>A reference to the mathematics term <i class="calibre5">real number</i>; analogous to Python’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">float</span> type</p>
<p class="listplain"><span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">TEXT </span>Analogous to Python’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">str</span> type</p>
<p class="listplain"><span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">BLOB </span>Short for <i class="calibre5">Binary Large Object</i>; analogous to Python’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">bytes</span> type and useful for storing entire files in a database</p>
<p class="tni">SQLite has its own data types because it wasn’t built just for Python; other programming languages can interact with SQLite databases as well.</p>
<p class="tx"><span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-1165" aria-label="390"></span>Unlike other SQL database software, SQLite isn’t strict about the data types of its columns. This means SQLite will, by default, gladly store the string <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'Hello'</span> in an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INTEGER</span> column without raising an exception. But SQLite’s data types aren’t entirely cosmetic, either; SQLite automatically <i class="calibre5">casts</i> (that is, changes) data to the column’s data type if possible, a feature called <i class="calibre5">type affinity</i>. For example, if you add the string <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'42'</span> to an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INTEGER</span> column, SQLite automatically stores the value as the integer <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">42</span>, because the column has a type affinity for integers. However, if you add the string <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'Hello'</span> to an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INTEGER</span> column, SQLite will store <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'Hello'</span> (without error), because despite the integer type affinity, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'Hello'</span> cannot be converted to an integer.</p>
<p class="tx">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">STRICT</span> keyword enables <i class="calibre5">strict mode</i> for this table. Under strict mode, every column must be given a data type, and SQLite will raise a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3.IntegrityError</span> exception if you try to insert data of the wrong type into the table. SQLite will still automatically cast data to the column’s data type; inserting <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'42'</span> into an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INTEGER</span> column would insert the integer <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">42</span>. However, the string <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'Hello'</span> cannot be cast to an integer, so attempting to insert it would raise an exception. I highly recommend using strict mode; it can give you an early warning about bugs caused by inserting incorrect data into your table.</p>
<p class="tx">SQLite added the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">STRICT</span> keyword in version 3.37.0, which is used by Python 3.11 and later. Earlier versions don’t know about strict mode and will report a syntax error if you attempt to use it. You can always check the version of SQLite that Python is using by examining the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3.sqlite _version</span> variable, which will look something like this:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">import sqlite3</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">sqlite3.sqlite_version</b>
'3.<var class="calibre20">xx</var>.<var class="calibre20">xx</var>'
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">SQLite doesn’t have a Boolean data type, so use <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INTEGER</span> for Boolean data instead; you can store a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1</span> to represent <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">True</span> and a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">0</span> to represent <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">False</span>. SQLite also doesn’t have a date, time, or datetime data type. Instead, you can use the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">TEXT</span> data type to store a string in a format listed in Table 16-1.</p>

<p class="tni">All SQLite databases have a table named <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite_schema</span> that lists metadata about the database, including all of its tables. To list the tables in the SQLite database, run the following query:</p>

<p class="listplain"><b class="calibre10">Column position</b> The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1</span> indicates that the column is second in the table. Column numbers are zero based, like Python list indexes, so the first column is at position 0.</p>
<p class="listplain"><b class="calibre10">Name</b> <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'birthdate'</span> is the name of the column. Remember that SQLite column and table names are case insensitive.</p>
<p class="listplain"><b class="calibre10">Data type</b> <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'TEXT'</span> is the SQLite data type of the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">birthdate</span> column.</p>

<p class="tni"><i class="calibre5">CRUD</i> is an acronym for the four basic operations that databases carry out: creating data, reading data, updating data, and deleting data. In SQLite, we perform these operations with <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INSERT</span>, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">SELECT</span>, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">UPDATE</span>, and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">DELETE</span> statements, respectively. Here are examples of each statement, which we’ll later pass as strings to <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">conn.execute()</span>:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="bl"><span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INSERT INTO cats VALUES ("Zophie", "2021-01-24", "black", 5.6)</span></li>
<li class="bl"><span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">SELECT rowid, * FROM cats ORDER BY fur</span></li>
<li class="bl"><span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">UPDATE cats SET fur</span> <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">=</span> <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">"gray tabby" WHERE rowid</span> <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">=</span> <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1</span></li>

</ul>
<p class="tx">Most applications and social media websites are really just fancy user interfaces for a CRUD database. When you post a photo or reply, you’re creating a record in a database somewhere. When you scroll through a social media timeline, you’re reading records from the database. And when you edit or delete a post, you’re performing an update or a deletion operation. Whenever you’re learning a new app, programming language, or query language, use the CRUD acronym to remind yourself of which basic operations you should find out about.</p>

<p class="tni">Now that we’ve created the database and a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">cats</span> table, let’s insert records for my pet cats. I have about 300 cats in my home, and using a SQLite database helps me keep track of them. An <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INSERT</span> statement can add new records to a table. Enter the following code into the interactive shell:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">import sqlite3</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db', isolation_level=None)</b>

<h5 class="h2" id="calibre_link-1900"><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Transactions</span></h5>
<p class="tni">An <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INSERT</span> statement begins a <i class="calibre5">transaction</i>, which is a unit of work in a database. Transactions must pass the <i class="calibre5">ACID test</i>, a database concept meaning that transactions are:</p>
<p class="listplain"><b class="calibre10">Atomic</b> The transaction is carried out either completely or not at all.</p>
<p class="listplain"><b class="calibre10">Consistent</b> The transaction doesn’t violate constraints, such as <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">NOT NULL</span> rules for columns.</p>
<p class="listplain"><b class="calibre10">Isolated</b> One transaction doesn’t affect other transactions.</p>
<p class="listplain"><b class="calibre10">Durable</b> If committed, the transaction results are written to persistent storage, such as the hard drive.</p>
<p class="tx">SQLite is an ACID-compliant database; it has even passed tests that simulate the computer losing power in the middle of a transaction, so you have high assurance that the database file won’t be left in a corrupt, unusable state. A SQLite query will either completely insert data into the database or not insert it at all.</p>

<h5 class="h2" id="calibre_link-1901"><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">SQL Injection Attacks</span></h5>
<p class="tni">A category of hacking techniques called <i class="calibre5">SQL injection attacks</i> can change your queries to do things you didn’t intend. These techniques are beyond the scope of this book, and they mostly likely are not an issue for your code if your program isn’t accepting data from strangers on the internet. But to prevent them, use the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">?</span> question mark syntax whenever you reference variables when inserting or updating data in your database.</p>
<p class="tx">For example, if I want to insert a new cat record based on data stored in variables, I shouldn’t insert these variables directly into the query string using Python, like this:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">cat_name = 'Zophie'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">cat_bday = '2021-01-24'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">fur_color = 'black'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">cat_weight = 5.6</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">conn.execute(f'INSERT INTO cats VALUES ("{cat_name}", "{cat_bday}",</b>
<b class="calibre10">"{fur_color}", {cat_weight})')</b>
&lt;sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x0000022B91BB7C40&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">If the values of these variables came from user input such as a web app form, a hacker could potentially specify strings that changed the meaning of the query. Instead, I should use a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">?</span> in the query string, then pass the variables in a list argument following the query string:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">conn.execute('INSERT INTO cats VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)', [cat_name, cat_bday,</b>
<b class="calibre10">fur_color, cat_weight])</b>
&lt;sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x0000022B91BB7C40&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">execute()</span> method replaces the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">?</span> placeholders in the query string with the variable values after making sure they won’t cause a SQL injection attack. <span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-781" aria-label="394"></span>While such attacks are unlikely to apply to your code, it’s a good habit to use the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">?</span> placeholders instead of formatting the query string yourself.</p>

<p class="tni">Once there’s data inside the database, you can read it with a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">SELECT</span> query. Enter the following into the interactive shell to read data from the <i class="calibre5">example.db</i> database:</p>

</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">execute()</span> method call for the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">SELECT</span> query returns a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Cursor</span> object. To obtain the actual data, we call the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">fetchall()</span> method on this <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Cursor</span> object. Each record is returned as a tuple in the list of tuples. The data in each tuple appears in the order of the table’s columns.</p>
<p class="tx">Instead of writing Python code to sort through this list of tuples yourself, you can make SQLite extract the specific information you want. The example <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">SELECT</span> query has four parts:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="bl">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">SELECT</span> keyword</li>
<li class="bl">The columns you want to retrieve, where <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">*</span> means “all columns except <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">rowid</span>”</li>
<li class="bl">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">FROM</span> keyword</li>
<li class="bl">The table to retrieve data from; in this case, the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">cats</span> table</li>
</ul>
<p class="tx">If you wanted just the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">rowid</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">name</span> columns of records in the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">cats</span> table, your query would look like this:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">conn.execute('SELECT rowid, name FROM cats').fetchall()</b>

<h5 class="h2" id="calibre_link-1908"><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Creating Indexes for Faster Data Reading</span></h5>
<p class="tni">In a previous section, we ran a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">SELECT</span> query to find records based on matching names. You could speed up this search by creating an index on the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">name</span> <span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-1054" aria-label="399"></span>column. A <i class="calibre5">SQL index</i> is a data structure that organizes a column’s data. As a result, queries with <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">WHERE</span> clauses that use these columns will perform better. The downside is that the index takes up a little bit more storage, so queries that insert or update data will be slightly slower, because SQLite must also update the data’s index. If your database is large, and you read data from it more often than you insert or update its data, creating an index may be worthwhile. However, you should conduct testing to verify that the index actually improves performance.</p>
<p class="tx">To create indexes on, say, the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">names</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">birthdate</span> columns in the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">cats</span> table, run the following <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">CREATE INDEX</span> queries:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">import sqlite3</b>

&lt;sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x0000013EC121A040&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">Indexes require names, and by convention, we name them after the column to which they apply, along with the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">idx_</span> prefix. Index names are global across the entire database, so if the database contains multiple tables with columns named <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">birthdate</span>, you may also want to include the table in the index name, like <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">idx_cats_birthdate</span>. To see all the indexes that exist for a table, check the built-in <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite_schema</span> table with a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">SELECT</span> query:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">conn.execute('SELECT name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type = "index" AND</b>
<b class="calibre10">tbl_name = "cats"').fetchall()</b>
[('idx_name',), ('idx_birthdate',)]
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">If you change your mind or find that the indexes aren’t improving performance, you can delete them with a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">DROP INDEX</span> query:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">conn.execute('SELECT name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type = "index" AND</b>

<p class="tx">It’s a common bug to forget the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">WHERE</span> clause when updating data. For example, if you wanted to do a find-and-replace to change every cat with <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'white and orange'</span> fur to <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'orange and white'</span> fur, you would run the following:</p>

<p class="tx">To avoid this bug, always include a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">WHERE</span> clause in your <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">UPDATE</span> queries, even if you intend to apply a change to every row.

Since <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1</span> is the value that SQLite uses for a Boolean <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">True</span>, this tells SQLite to apply the change to every row.

<p class="tni">A friend of mine was once making changes to a database used by an e-commerce site specializing in collectible sports cards.

Without a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">WHERE</span> clause, the query updated every one of the thousands of cards for sale on the website.</p>
<p class="tx">Fortunately, she had backups of the database, so she could restore it to its previous state. (This was especially useful because the same thing happened again in the exact same way, making her suspect the cat was doing it on purpose.)</p>
<p class="tx">If a program isn’t currently accessing the SQLite database, you can back it up by simply copying the database file. A Python program might do this by calling <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">shutil.copy('sweigartcats.db', 'backup.db')</span>, as described in <span>Chapter 11</span>. If your software is constantly reading or updating the database’s contents, however, you’ll need to use the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Connection</span> object’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">backup()</span> method instead.

<p class="tni">The structure of SQLite tables is rather strict; for example, each row has a set number of columns. But real-world data is often more complicated than a single table can capture. In relational databases, we can store complex data across multiple tables, and we can create links between them called <i class="calibre5">foreign keys</i>.</p>
<p class="tx">Say we want to store information about the vaccinations our cats receive. We can’t just add columns to our <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">cats</span> table, as each cat could have one vaccination or many. Also, for each vaccination, we’d also want to list the vaccination date and the name of the doctor who administered it. SQL tables are not good at storing a list of columns. You would not want to have columns named <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">vaccination1</span>, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">vaccination2</span>, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">vaccination3</span>, and so on, for the same reason you wouldn’t want variables named <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">vaccination1</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">vaccination2</span>. If you create too many columns or variables, your code becomes a verbose, unreadable mess. If you create too few, you will have to constantly update your program to add more as needed.</p>

<p class="tni">At times, you may want to investigate a SQLite database directly without having to write all of this extraneous Python code. You can do so by installing the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3</span> command, which runs from a terminal command line window and is documented at <i class="calibre5"><a href="https://sqlite.org/cli.html" class="calibre1">https://<wbr></wbr>sqlite<wbr></wbr>.org<wbr></wbr>/cli<wbr></wbr>.html</a></i>.</p>
<p class="tx">On Windows, download the files labeled “A bundle of command line tools for managing SQLite database files” from <i class="calibre5"><a href="https://sqlite.org/download.html" class="calibre1">https://<wbr></wbr>sqlite<wbr></wbr>.org<wbr></wbr>/download<wbr></wbr>.html</a></i> and place the <i class="calibre5">sqlite3.exe</i> program in a folder on the system <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">PATH</span>. (See <span>Chapter 12</span> for information about the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">PATH</span> environment variable and terminal windows.) The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3</span> command is preinstalled on macOS. For UbuntuLinux, run <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sudo apt install sqlite3</span> to install it.</p>
<p class="tx">Next, in a terminal window, run <b class="calibre10">sqlite3 example.db</b> to connect to the database in <i class="calibre5">example.db</i>. If this file doesn’t exist, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3</span> creates this file with an empty database. You can enter SQL queries into this tool, though unlike the queries passed to <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">conn.execute()</span> in Python, they must end with a semicolon.</p>
<p class="tx"><span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-981" aria-label="408"></span>For example, enter the following into the terminal window:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">C:\Users\Al&gt;<b class="calibre10">sqlite3 example.db</b>
SQLite version 3.<var class="calibre20">xx.xx</var>
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite&gt; <b class="calibre10">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cats (name TEXT NOT NULL,</b>
<b class="calibre10">birthdate TEXT, fur TEXT, weight_kg REAL) STRICT;</b>
sqlite&gt; <b class="calibre10">INSERT INTO cats VALUES ('Zophie', '2021-01-24', 'gray tabby', 4.7);</b>
sqlite&gt; <b class="calibre10">SELECT * from cats;</b>
Zophie|2021-01-24|gray tabby|4.7
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">As you can see in this example, the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3</span> command line tool provides a sort of SQLite interactive shell for you to enter queries at its <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite&gt;</span> prompt. The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">.help</span> command displays additional commands, such as <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">.tables</span> (which shows the tables in the database) and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">.headers</span> (which lets you turn column headers on or off):</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">sqlite&gt; <b class="calibre10">.tables</b>
cats
sqlite&gt; <b class="calibre10">.headers on</b>
sqlite&gt; <b class="calibre10">SELECT * from cats;</b>
name|birthdate|fur|weight_kg
Zophie|2021-01-24|gray tabby|4.7
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">If the command line tool is too sparse for you, there are also free, open source apps for displaying SQLite databases in a graphical user interface (GUI) on Windows, macOS, and Linux:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="bl">DB Browser for SQLite (<i class="calibre5"><a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org" class="calibre1">https://<wbr></wbr>sqlitebrowser<wbr></wbr>.org</a></i>)</li>
<li class="bl">SQLite Studio (<i class="calibre5"><a href="https://sqlitestudio.pl" class="calibre1">https://<wbr></wbr>sqlitestudio<wbr></wbr>.pl</a></i>)</li>
<li class="bl">DBeaver Community (<i class="calibre5"><a href="https://dbeaver.io" class="calibre1">https://<wbr></wbr>dbeaver<wbr></wbr>.io</a></i>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="tx">While these GUI apps make it easier to work with SQLite databases, it’s still worth learning the text-based syntax of SQLite queries.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-1918"><span id="calibre_link-450"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Summary</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Computers make it possible to deal with large amounts of data, but simply putting data into a text file, or even a spreadsheet, might not organize it well enough for you to make efficient use of it. SQL databases such as SQLite offer an advanced way to not only store large amounts of information but also retrieve the precise data you want through the SQL language.</p>
<p class="tx">SQLite is an impressive database, and Python comes with the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sqlite3</span> module in its standard library. SQLite’s version of SQL is different from that used in other relational databases, but it’s similar enough that learning SQLite provides a good introduction to databases in general.</p>
<p class="tx"><span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-998" aria-label="409"></span>SQLite databases live in a single file without a dedicated server. They can contain multiple tables (which you can think of as analogous to spreadsheets), and each table can contain multiple columns. To edit a table’s values, you can perform the CRUD operations (for create, read, update, and delete) with the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">INSERT</span>, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">SELECT</span>, <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">UPDATE</span>, and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">DELETE</span> queries. To change tables and columns themselves, you can use the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">ALTER TABLE</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">DROP TABLE</span> queries. Lastly, foreign keys allow you to link records in multiple tables together using a technique called joins.</p>
<p class="tx">There’s a lot more to SQLite and databases than can be covered in one chapter. If you’d like to learn more about SQL databases in general, I recommend <i class="calibre5">Practical SQL,</i> 2nd edition (No Starch Press, 2022) by Anthony DeBarros.</p>

<h4 class="h1" id="calibre_link-1922"><span id="calibre_link-454"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Meal Ingredients Database</span></h4>
<p class="tni">Write a program that creates two tables, one for meals and one for ingredients, using these SQL queries:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS meals (name TEXT) STRICT
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ingredients (name TEXT,
meal_id INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY(meal_id) REFERENCES meals
(rowid)) STRICT
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">Then, write a program that prompts the user for input. If the user enters <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'quit'</span>, the program should exit. The user can also enter a new meal name, followed by a colon and a comma-delimited list of ingredients: <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">'meal:ingredient1,ingredient2'</span>. Save the meal and its ingredients in the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">meals</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">ingredients</span> tables.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, the user can enter the name of a meal or ingredient. If the name appears in the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">meals</span> table, the program should list the meal’s ingredients. If the name appears in the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">ingredients</span> table, the program should list every meal that uses this ingredient. For example, the output of the program could look like this:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt; <b class="calibre10">onigiri:rice,nori,salt,sesame seeds</b>
Meal added: onigiri
&gt; <b class="calibre10">chicken and rice:chicken,rice,cream of chicken soup</b>
Meal added: chicken and rice
&gt; <b class="calibre10">onigiri</b>
Ingredients of onigiri:
  rice
  nori
  salt
  sesame seeds
&gt; <b class="calibre10">chicken</b>
Meals that use chicken:
  chicken and rice
&gt; <b class="calibre10">rice</b>
Meals that use rice:
  onigiri
chicken and rice
&gt; <b class="calibre10">quit</b>
